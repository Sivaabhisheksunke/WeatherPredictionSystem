# WeatherPredictionSystem
Developed a machine learning model for predicting the weather based on past weather data. Conducted data preprocessing, feature development, and EDA, which condensed over 50 weather labels into meaningful categories. Trained and tested various models using cross-validation, reaching a level of about 69% accuracy using the Random Forest model.
